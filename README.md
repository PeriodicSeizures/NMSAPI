# NBTAPI
No more crazy reflections that are hard to read and inherently slow

## As a dependency

Requires Maven or Gradle
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.crazicrafter1</groupId>
    <artifactId>nmsapi</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
</repository>
```

I havnt tested whether the build above ^ works

Just see AnvilGUI README https://github.com/WesJD/AnvilGUI or Gapi for an example build script for Gradle as this was difficult for me to figure out https://github.com/PeriodicSeizures/Gapi/blob/main/build.gradle
